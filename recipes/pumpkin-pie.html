        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The only recipe for Vegan Pumpkin Pie you'll ever need, and it's perfect for the holidays! SO easy to make with only 9 ingredients. No one will guess it's vegan!</p><br/>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree</li>
            <li>1 cup coconut cream</li>
            <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ginger</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon cloves</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 recipe Easy Vegan Pie Crust</li>
            <li>Vegan Whipped Cream optional, for serving</li>
        </ul><br/>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare a pie crust in a pie plate.</li>
            <li>Add the canned pumpkin, coconut cream, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, salt and cornstarch to a blender and blend until very smooth. You may also simply whisk it together in a bowl until smooth.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into a 9-inch pan lined with a pie crust. May use a vegan store bought vegan pie crust, my Easy Vegan Pie Crust, or this Gluten Free Pie Crust. I don't pre-cook the pie crust. Spread the mixture evenly with a spatula.</li>
            <li>Bake for 1 hour. If the crust starts to burn, cover the edges of the crust with aluminum foil or a pie shield after about 30 minutes of baking. The middle will still look jiggly; that's normal. Let cool at room temperature for 30 minutes, then cover and transfer to the refrigerator to chill for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>Slice and serve with Vegan Whipped Cream or store bought non-dairy whipped topping, if desired. Enjoy!</li>
            <li>For the Pie Crust Leaves: These are totally optional for decoration. Make or buy an extra pie crust, and roll out the dough about 1/8th inch thick. Using leaf cookie cutters, cut into shapes. Place on a baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes at 350 degrees F. </li>
